Using fatfs on SPI flash... what about wear-levelling?
e.g. does ESP32 wear-levelling accommodate this?
Why would one ever wish to use FAT on an SPI flash chip?

#3633: Getting wrong flash capacity after f_mkfs
Name: MisterBirra
Child: #3634 

I'm using FatFs 0.14b with SPI flash "W25Q128FV".
It has capacity of 16777216 bytes.
Accordingly to datasheet, I've implemented disk_ioctl() with:
- SECTOR_SIZE = 4096 (each sector is 4KB)
- BLOCK_SIZE = 16 (each block contains 16 sectors)
- SECTOR_COUNT = capacity / sectorsize = 4096

To initialize the flash, I call mfks with:

BYTE work[SECTOR_SIZE];
MKFS_PARM p = {FM_FAT | FM_FAT32, 1, 0, 0, SECTOR_SIZE};
f_mkfs("", &p, work, sizeof work);

It works, but the value returned by FatFs.capacity() is... 2008 Kbytes.
Why this number?
