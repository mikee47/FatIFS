#3687: Merge sequential diskio will boost performance
Name: bloodmage @Internet
Child: #3688 

Currently f_read/f_write splits disk_read/write calls from sector boundary.
A simple merge mechanism would improve r/w performance.

I made a patch for this. see:
https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/compare/master...bloodmage:esp-idf:patch-1
It may meet produce behavior inconsistence when error happened during writing.

A simple benchmark using 16k buffer size read, on 4k sector size fat32 sdcard,
and with 20Mhz freq sdmmc interface, a 33% performance gain is observed. (From 4MB/s to 5.3MB/s)
