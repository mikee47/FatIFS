#3689: PATCH: support for exFAT timezone offset
Name: Richard @Internet
 

Here is a patch that adds support for the timezone offset field of exFAT directory entries

https://web.tresorit.com/l/pbmj5#QUICdk8pWEhj3eIjygmykw

The patch introduces a new config setting FF_EXFAT_TZ. Setting that to 1 will change

- the FILINFO structure will have a new field ftz_ofs that holds the timezone offset of the directory entry
  (as stored in the filesystem). This enables you to display the correct date/time to the user.

- the fat_gettime() user-supplied function return value is changed from DWORD to QWORD, a new type
  FATTIME_t is introduced to keep the code readable. The fat_gettime() function needs to return the
  timezone offset (exFAT encoded in a single byte) in bits 32-39 of the return value. Or you can also
  return all zeros in these bits to indicate that no timezone offset is available.

- if you use f_utime to set explicate date/time, make sure to also set the new ftz_ofs field (either to
  the correct value or 0).

This timezone offset support is important for exFAT filesystems created or changed on macOS, since
macOS uses a very weird (though technically correct) timezone: if you live in UTC+x (choose any x) then
macOS stores the date/time with timezone UTC-x in the filesystem. Ignoring the timezone offset will
thus result in displaying date/time values shifted by 2x.
