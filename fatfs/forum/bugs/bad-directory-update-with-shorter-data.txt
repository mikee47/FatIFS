#3682: Bad directory update with shorter data.
Name: thln47 @Internet
 

Hi everyone,

I use Fatfs to store data on file. I've downloaded the R0.14b (04/04/2022) revision from 'http://elm-chan.org' web site.
My disk size is 256K, an the disk format is FAT12. I found a mistake on writing shorter data on the same file.
It's occurs only when shorter data is written.

explanation:
I write "TOTO :)" (7 bytes long) on my file, then I check it.
The first write operation is done without problem.
I write again the same file but with 4 bytes only "TEST".
When I read again the result is "TEST :)" but not "TEST".


I've modified f_write function in ff.c source file to get the right size.
but I don't know if my code will occur bad behavior in other situation.

 ...
 /* Check fptr wrap-around (file size cannot reach 4 GiB at FAT volume) */
 if ((!FF_FS_EXFAT || fs->fs_type != FS_EXFAT) && (DWORD)(fp->fptr + btw) < (DWORD)fp->fptr) {
  btw = (UINT)(0xFFFFFFFF - (DWORD)fp->fptr);
 }
#ifdef _MODIF_THLN
 if (btw < fp->obj.objsize ) {
  fp->obj.objsize = btw;
 }
#endif
 for ( ; btw > 0; btw -= wcnt, *bw += wcnt, wbuff += wcnt, fp->fptr += wcnt, fp->obj.objsize = (fp->fptr > fp->obj.objsize) ? fp->fptr : fp->obj.objsize) { /* Repeat until all data written */
 ...

Let me know if someone had the same error and better correction.

Thanks for reply,
