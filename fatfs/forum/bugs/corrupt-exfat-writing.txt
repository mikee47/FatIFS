#3642: EXFAT f_read works but f_write corrupts the folder
Name: Nima Eskandari @USA
Child: #3643 

Hello,

I have implemented FATFS for the TMS320F28388D MCU and everything works fine. HOWEVER, when I use exFAT,
with a correctly formatted SDXC card, the f_read function works correctly (f_open with only read access) while the
f_write function (f_open with write/create/append) corrupt the current folder. If the current folder is the top directory,
the whole SD card is corrupted.

After the use of the f_write, the next time the same application is run, the f_mount function fails with DISK_ERR.


It is important to note that although f_open and f_write corrupt the filesystem, the first time they are run on a correctly
formatted SD card, they return FR_OK.

Any help would be EXTREMELY helpful as I am stuck!

Nima

Unfortunately, Fatfs won't work on the C2000 and any uC in size of char is not 8-bit.
Fatfs requires the char type be 8-bit.
