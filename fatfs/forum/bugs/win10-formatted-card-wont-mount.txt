#3640: I can't use sd card formatted with windows10
Name: Hiroaki Kominami @Japan
Child: #3641 

Hello,

I'm using FatFs R0.14b with RTOS.
When I format an SD card with a capacity of 32GB or less with the standard function of windows10, an error occurs when reading with FatFs.

The function with the error is mount_volume()
It having a problem with the code below
  ff.c: 3509: if (fs-> fsize <(szbfat + (SS (fs) -1)) / SS (fs)) return FR_NO_FILESYSTEM;

For the SD card 32GB I have
  fs-> fsize: 15304
  szbfat: 7835912
  SS (fs): 512

Is this just my problem?
windows problem?
Or is it a Fatfs problem?
I can't judge.

I would appreciate it if you could tell me how to improve it.

Thank you and best regards,
