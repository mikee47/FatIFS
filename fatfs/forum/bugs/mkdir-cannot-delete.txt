#3608: f_mkdir() R0.13b under MPLAB 5.45
Name: anightin @UK
Child: #3609 #3611 

I am using the f_mkdir() call for my SD_Card application on an SPI SD interface driven by a PIC18F27K40.

The directory is created Okay and even renamed, but cannot subsequently be deleted by f_unlink(), or via Windows10.

The only solution is to re-format the card.

If I create the directory on Windows10, then it can be deleted.


Is there a corrected version of the library that I should be using?

On further investigation the f_unlink() command reports that the (empty) directory created with f_mkdir() is not empty.

Thanks

#3611: Seems to be a write data error issue

Looks like an issue with the underlying SD SPI driver called by the DiskIO:
